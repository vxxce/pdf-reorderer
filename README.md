# pdf-reorderer
This is a command line program to automate the re-ordering of a PDFs pages required for bookbinding projects using folded single-sheet 4- or 8- leaf signatures
(AKA "gatherings"). If the pdf is not evenly divisable by 16, blank pages are written and inserted spliced into the specific positions required to keep blank pages together in rear of book after folding.

At present, only 4- and 8-leaf signatures are supported.

I am hoping to improve this program by
* supporting additional binding formats and styles
* creating a simple web-based GUI
* collating and re-orienting pages to single sheets of variable dimensions.
* reflowing / formatting pdf content to allow for major adjustments to page-dimensions (IMO the standard 8.5 x 11 ratio is not an especially friendly format for most books).

Happy to collaborate if you have any other ideas or want to work on any of the improvements above!
